 Carpenter, deputy director of the US non-governmental research organization the Cato Institute,
 holds that Bush's criticism of Korea by name is really hard to understand.
 The deputy director said, "It's really strange for Bush to include Korea on the list of these countries,
 because in recent years Korea has not actively supported terrorist activities. Furthermore, "according to evidence in our hands," he added,
 "Korea's nuclear project has all along been frozen since the mid-1990s. I don't know why Bush listed Korea as one among the terrorist countries."

But Daschle also saw the three countries as threats to the United States, saying that Bush was
"right in calling attention to the danger they pose to the United States."
"I think that it's important for us to look at each of these countries as threats to this country clearly,
as problems that we' ve got to address clearly", he said.
